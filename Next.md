## Purpose

This document outlines my roadmap for digital restoration, developer education, legal evidence management, and platform sovereignty. Every step listed here will be tied to a traceable commit, declaration, or forensic action.

---

## Objectives

### Phase I – Foundations (August 2025)
- [x] Create secure GitHub repository (`AlamoFire-Rootstack`)
- [x] Publish README.md (identity statement)
- [x] Publish `legal_notice.md` (platform demand letter)
- [ ] Write `manifest.md` (philosophical declaration of authorship)
- [ ] Publish `timeline.md` (systemic hijack chronology)
- [ ] Publish `next.md` (this document)

### Phase II – Developer Learning Path
- [ ] Begin Swift basics (functions, variables, logic flow)
- [ ] Create `first.swift` (hello-world with declared authorship)
- [ ] Learn Git commands: commit, push, pull, branch, merge
- [ ] Set up Xcode (local or cloud) for iOS development
- [ ] Build secure shell interface for digital ID proofing
- [ ] Document learning in `logbook.md`

### Phase III – Forensic Tools & Public Visibility
- [ ] Create repo: `fraud-matrix-kp` (alias mapping + actors)
- [ ] Publish `evidence_index.md` (index of named financial institutions and shell accounts)
- [ ] Connect repo with CRA audit request via Privacy Commissioner
- [ ] Build `digital-presence-validator.swift` (tool to cross-check spoofed identity infrastructure)
- [ ] Build educational resource for erased or cloned victims

## Operating Principles

1. Nothing silent. Everything is logged, public, provable.  
2. No redaction. All aliases, mirrors, and actors will be documented.  
3. My name. My children. My code. No identity but mine will ever sign this work.  
4. From memory to method. What I saw, I will now encode.

## Commit Strategy

Each file in this repository will represent:  
- A published truth  
- A coded recovery  
- A publicly visible line in the story of how I got back my name

This roadmap is open, iterative, and sovereign.
