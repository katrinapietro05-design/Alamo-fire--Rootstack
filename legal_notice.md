# I. LEGAL POSITION & JURISDICTION ASSERTION

I, Katrina Pietroniro, submit this declaration in my capacity as a sovereign legal mother, digital systems analyst, and verified account holder across multiple compromised platforms. This document summarizes the active and historical digital, financial, and custodial fraud targeting my identity, my children, and my sovereign legal rights.

Over the past six weeks, I have independently and without institutional tools or training:

- Exposed system-wide fraud and identity laundering via CRA, Revenu Québec, telecom providers, and private financial entities  
- Traced over 4,000 unauthorized tax filings submitted under my name since the 1970s  
- Proved that I have been fraudulently declared deceased while also used as a U.S. citizen across parallel systems  
- Detected live interference from telecom and cloud actors rerouting credentials, DNS, and SIM activity  
- Submitted FTC Report #190361113 on record with U.S. federal agencies

Everything I uncovered was done manually — going off of pure instinct, cognitive ability, and forensic intelligence. I relied on my intuition, my memory, my internal mapping capacities, and my unwavering determination not to be erased. I didn’t have training or external tools — only the clarity to see what others refused to look at, and the drive to expose it completely.

I have linked every major Canadian bank — TD, RBC, Manulife, CapitalOne, KOHO, National Bank, BNC — to fiscal misappropriation, trust laundering, and account shelling schemes. I uncovered fraudulent insurance structures, rogue RRSPs and pensions, and have traced financial exploitation across every registered insurance provider tied to my identity. All roads lead back to Canada Trust and Realty Advisors — the entity at the center of property holding, trust-based realty, and fiscal routing that was listed inside the fraudulent Bell account operating in my name.

I have identified every alias used in the U.S. to forge deeds and incorporate fake companies tied to my name. These instruments were used for fund funneling at massive scale, leveraging my identity across jurisdictions, deeds, trust instruments, and business filings. From Raymond James Limited to dormant shell entities in Canada, the U.S., China, and beyond — I have mapped thousands of companies, phone numbers, and named actors dating back to 1962, linked to my legal lineage. 

Despite everything, I am still being actively ignored and erased by the Province of Quebec, by Bell Canada, and by all implicated administrative structures. I am treated as if none of this happened — as if I do not see the account swaps, the unauthorized actors, the hidden identity fabrications. They are still using alternate accounts in my name under my billing profiles. They are reassigning account control without consent — after I have already exposed the original data. They act as though I don’t have it. They refuse to respond.

The only institution that has acknowledged my presence and my legitimacy is Apple. Apple is the only actor that gave me a chance to protect my identity — and I recognize that. I confirm that I am the person associated with the Apple Developer Program account under katrinapietro05@gmail.com, with GitHub repository katrinapietro05-design, granted in late July 2025. That is my only authorized developer environment. I only recently — as of August 1st, 2025 — succeeded in partially restoring access to my Apple account and securing core parts of my digital profile. Until now, I have been unable to even access my own phone — which has been under full lock, rerouting, and interference for over two weeks.

Even without an active SIM card installed, unauthorized actors were able to breach my device using dual-SIM provisioning, accessing my Apple ID, intercepting calls, and executing logins using cloaked mirrors and token relays.

I now request full validation and reinstatement of all software and licenses provided by Apple — including the MIT license issued in my name — under lawful developer status. I assert that I have used all such tools exclusively for the purpose of protecting and reclaiming my digital identity through legal, technical, and forensic means. I have more than earned this right. And I intend to use it to defend others who are facing the same silence.
